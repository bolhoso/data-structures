Some basic data structures implementations, like:
 - linked lists
 - stacks
 - queues (resizable and using linked lists)
 - deques
 - binary search tree
 - red black search trees

The implementations aren't related to each other, nor they compose a bigger solution.
They're just part of my studies to remember data structures using Coursera and
Sedgewick's Algorithms book.
